We describe an approach to model calibration and behavior parameter estimation used in the development and application of the Minnesota COVID-19 model. We address the computational challenges of frequent re-calibration with a sequential calibration approach, which takes advantage of previous calibration results and reduces the number of parameters to be estimated in each round of calibration, improving algorithm convergence to best-fitting parameter values. Facilitated by access to unique state-level COVID-19 data sets, we use our model calibration approach to disentangle age-specific contact parameter estimates from other changing pandemic elements.
