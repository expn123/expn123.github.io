I am a PhD student in [Health Services Research, Policy, and Administration](https://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/degrees-programs/phd/hsrpa/) at the University of Minnestoa, advised by professors [Eva Enns](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/eva-enns) and [Xiao Zang](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/xiao-zang). My research interests focus on applications and methods to inform decision-making on health policy-realted questions. Specifically, my research focuses on (1) applying simulation models to evaluate interventions targeting drug overdose; (2) evaluating policy decisions on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases; and (3) model calibration and validation. 

I received an MPH from Yale University and a BS in Laboratory Medicine and BA in economics from Peking University.
