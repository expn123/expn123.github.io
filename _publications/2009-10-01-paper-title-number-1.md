title: "Adaptive COVID-19 mitigation strategies: tradeoffs between trigger thresholds, response timing, and effectiveness"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This study uses a mathematical model to compare different adaptive nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies for COVID-19 management across 3 dimensions: threshold when the NPI should be implemented, time it takes to implement the NPI, and the effectiveness of the NPI. All adaptive NPI response scenarios considered substantially reduced peak hospitalizations compared with no response.'
